# X

**A lightweight, Erlang-inspired virtual machine for concurrent, fault-tolerant applications in Crystal.**

This project combines a clean **stack-based bytecode interpreter** with **actor-model concurrency**, lightweight processes, message passing, supervision trees, and built-in fault tolerance — all implemented in pure Crystal.

Inspired by Erlang's BEAM, but designed to be simple, hackable, and embeddable.

## Features

- **Stack-based VM** — Predictable execution with a growing instruction set
- **Actor-model concurrency** — Thousands of lightweight processes, isolated mailboxes
- **Fault tolerance** — Linking, monitoring, supervision trees (one-for-one, one-for-all)
- **First-class data** — Maps, arrays, strings, atoms with native operations
- **Built-in primitives** — IO, process operations, yield/scheduling hooks
- **Pure Crystal** — No external dependencies beyond stdlib (easy to embed/extend)

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add X to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  x:
    github: konjac-lang/x
```

Then run:

```bash
shards install
```

## Why choose this project?

- Want to experiment with actor-model semantics without Erlang/OTP?
- Building a domain-specific language or embedded runtime in Crystal?
- Curious how BEAM-like supervision can work in a stack VM?

This project is small (~few thousand LOC), readable, and meant for learning/hacking.
